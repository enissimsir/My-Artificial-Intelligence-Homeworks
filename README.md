There is a report for each of the projects
The semester project: The aim of our project is to create an agent that learns to play a game coded with the pygame library. We provided the agent's learning process with the DQN method.
The homework 1: We created a model with the help of a data set consisting of positive and negative sentences. The model works with a genetic evolution algorithm and reaches a high fitness value after a certain number of generations.
The homework 2: A survey containing 10 questions was prepared and filled in by 231 people. The 11th question asks whether the person is an introvert or an extrovert. The aim of our project is to predict the answer to the 11th question by looking at the first 10 questions.
